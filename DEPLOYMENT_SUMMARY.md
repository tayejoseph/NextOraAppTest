# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Summary

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

Your Next.js landing page now has a complete CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests and deploys to Google Cloud Platform.

### Files Created:

1. `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
2. `Dockerfile` - Production container build
3. `.dockerignore` - Build optimization
4. `app/api/health/route.ts` - Health monitoring endpoint
5. `CI-CD-SETUP.md` - Setup documentation

### Pipeline Behavior:

- **Tests First**: All 16 tests must pass before deployment
- **Deployment Block**: Failed tests prevent deployment
- **GCP Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Cloud Run on main branch
- **Health Checks**: Smoke tests verify deployment success

### Current Status:

- All tests passing ✅
- Pipeline configured ✅
- Ready for GCP deployment ✅

### Next Steps:

1. Configure GCP project (follow CI-CD-SETUP.md)
2. Add GitHub secrets
3. Push to main branch to deploy

The pipeline ensures your application is thoroughly tested before any deployment to production.
